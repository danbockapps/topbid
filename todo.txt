New smarter Ajax:
1. Call function with parameter 0
2. Function downloads last_update.php
2a. Offset = server time minus local time
3. Function compares parameter with last_update.php
4. If less than, then download new bid table
5. If equal to, then js updates times on page
6. If greater than, then something has gone wrong.
7. Wait 1 second, then call function with parameter from last_update.php.

The new place_bid.php:
- 1. Insert any new bid
- 2. Show result of new bid
- 3. Lookup data based on GET player ID
- 4. Form posts new bid to place_bid.php
- Show my dollars available

Differences between dev and prod:
- Facebook app id (in two places)
- Facebook app secret
- css ?reload flag
- Address to channel file 

Run checks on bids first. exit with error if any are bad.
For each player:
   if I'm not entering a bid, then no change to dollars committed.
   if I am entering a bid:
      if I'm the current high bidder, then amt added is new bid - old max
      if I'm not the current high bidder:
         if new bid <= old max, amount added is 0
         else amount added is new bid.

If the amount is set:
   trim it
   if it's != ''
      enforce checks
